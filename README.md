# RockPaperScissorsLizardSpockbyDrago
A console based Java implementation of the "Rock Paper Scissors" game, with a little twist to it - adding two more options - Lizard and Spock.

Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock is a five-gesture expansion of the classic selection method game rock-paper-scissors. It operates on the same basic principle, but includes two additional weapons: the lizard (formed by the hand as a sock-puppet-like mouth) and Spock (formed by the Star Trek Vulcan salute). This reduces the chances of a round ending in a tie. The game was invented by Sam Kass with Karen Bryla, as "Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard".

Rules: The rules of Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock are: 
 Scissors cut paper 
 Paper covers rock 
 Rock crushes lizard 
 Lizard poisons Spock 
 Spock smashes (or melts) scissors 
 Scissors decapitate lizard  Lizard eats paper
 Paper disproves Spock 
 Spock vaporizes rock 
 Rock breaks scissors
